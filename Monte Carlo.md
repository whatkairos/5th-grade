# Monte Carlo π

You can the "Monte Carlo method" to approximate a difficult method. So in this case, we used the "Monte Carlo method" to approximate π.

We did the following steps:

1. We created a square piece of paper.
2. Then we drew a circle.
3. We closed our eyes and drew dots randomly on the piece of paper.
4. Then we counted the dots inside the circle and outside the circle.
5. And divided them(with the remainder).
6. And compared the answer to π.

The aproximation that we got was 3.33333... which is pretty close to 3.141592.
